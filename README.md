# Plotonium
Change plot styling for matplotlib. 
This is just modifying the rcParams. There are the styles

- `dark` (for my dark theme in VS Code)
- `report` (for use in my LaTeX templates)

## Use it
If the plotonium forder is in your scope (either in your project folder or in the python path), use
```python
from plotonium import dark
```
## Customize it
First of all, the colors can be easily changed in the Respective python files

Other than that, there are a lot or rcParams that can be changed:
